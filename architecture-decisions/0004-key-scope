# 1. Key scope

Date: 2021-06-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In many cases we can generate keys or tokens as-needed. We may also be able to create keys with varying permissions.

We'd like to reduce our vulnerability in the case of one of these keys becoming compromised, either via a compromised box or via a software exploit to application code.

## Decision

Keys should be minted on a per-feature, per-application basis.

## Consequences

* If a given feature is exploited through software vulnerability and that key is limited to the permissions needed for that feature, damage is also limited to the actions that key gives permission to perform.
* If a given box is exploited the need to rotate keys is minimized to just one machine.
