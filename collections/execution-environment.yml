# this file is a container-file generator
# once the container file (def) is done, ansible-builder creates 
# a container file, and optionally also builds an image
# based on the container file
# you can set builder to NOT actually build the image if you 
# want to use, say, Quay.io's builder services (or other)
#
# code is at https://github.com/ansible/ansible-builder
#
# current docs at ansible-builder.readthedocs.io
# 
# you should be able to use the simpler EE definition
# with builder 3, insntead of creating and committing 
# yoru containerfile as an intermediate step
#
#
# must declare a builder schema version
version: 3
# msut define base iumage
images:
  base_image:
    name: quay.io/centos/centos:stream9
    # typical container ref is host/namespace/container:tag
    # registry.fedoraproject.org/
    # can also use podman or docker shortcuts, but the full def is more portable/reliable
    # builder will warn if you don't install ansible
dependencies:
  # don't have to specify the python if python is included in the base image
  python_interpreter: 
    # requires the python we will call when we need to use python
    python_path: /usr/bin/python3.11
    # the default is /usr/bin/python3
    # some base images have no python installed
    # python will be installed with the package manager you define
    # default is DNF
    # package_system is only for python
    package_system: python3.11
  ansible_core:
    package_pip: ansible<=7
    # accepts standard pip syntax for defining versions
  ansible_runner:
    package_pip: ansible-runner
  # at this stage we have a vanilla container - it will build
  # but there are no collections or other dependencies included
  galaxy: requirements.yml # if defining in a separate requirements.yml, it must be in the same directory as the execution-environment.yml file or in a child directory on tne sa me path, not a random external path
  # default behavior is to pull the collections in this list
  # and run through their dependencies and install those
  # as well
  # currently you cannot turn this behavior off - comign soon!
  # you can embed your entire file as a string:
  # galaxy: |
      # with the pipe above, you can just copy your 
      #  requirements.yml with all your comments etc. there
      # This file tells Ansible Tower which collections to
      # load on the execution environment at runtime
      #collections:
      # Copied from https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/5/ansible-5.4.0.deps
      #  - name: ansible.netcommon
      #    version: 2.5.1
      #  - name: ansible.posix
      #    version: 1.3.0
  # or you can put the yaml inside the yaml like This
  # galaxy:
  #   collections:
  #     - name: ansible.netcommon
  #       version: 2.5.1
  #     - name: ansible.posix
  #       version: 1.3.0
  python: # can pass a file here or a list - file must be in the dir or path below ./
    # accepts the normal pip syntax for defining versions
    - pan-python
    - pan-os-python
  system:
    # uses a standard bindep format
    # can be os flavor-agnostic (use apt, etc.)
    - python3-dnf
additional_build_steps:
  # items in the list of append_base steps are expressed
  # as containerfile directives
  append_base:
    - RUN dnf install git -y
