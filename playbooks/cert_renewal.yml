# automates step 1 of https://github.com/pulibrary/pul-the-hard-way/blob/main/services/create_ssl_certs.md
# You must pass two variables and you can pass a third if you need it:
# 1. Pass the first element of the FQDN as '-e host_name=value'
# for example: '-e host_name=fun' would generate a cert for fun.princeton.edu
# 2. Pass the path of the directory on your local machine the key and cert should end up in
# with no trailing slash
# for example: '-e cert_path=/home/foo/ssl_certs'
# 3. If your cert needs one or more Subject Alt Names, pass a third variable for those
# for example: "-e SAN_name='DNS:altname.princeton.edu,DNS:otheraltname.princeton.edu'"
#
# Full example command:
# ansible-playbook playbooks/cert_renewal.yml -e host_name=new_site -e cert_path=/home/myuser/ssl_certs -e SAN_name='DNS:new_site1.princeton.edu'
#
# once you have the private key and CSR, follow the rest of the procedure documented on
# https://github.com/pulibrary/pul-the-hard-way/blob/main/services/create_ssl_certs.md
