# Ansible expects you to have `~/.aws/credentials` configured with an iam user
# you will need to create these on your own
# the playbook will create a group `{{ pul_group }}` if one does not exist
#
# your iam `{{ dev_user }}` will be given permissions assigned to the group
#
# pass the ansible variable for the group and the user as seen below:
#
# ansible-playbook -vv -e pul_group=rdss -e dev_user=bess playbooks/aws_group_access.yml
#
# NOTE: You may need to run `pipenv sync` in your princeton_ansible shell
# in order to install boto3 and other AWS required libraries.
