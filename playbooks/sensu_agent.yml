# installs the sensu-go agent on a monitored machine
# you must pass the target host group
# plus the environment and the app_name for the agent configuration
# For example:
# ansible-playbook playbooks/sensu_agent.yml -e group_name=pdc_describe_staging -e env=staging -e app_name=pdc_describe
- name: install and configure Sensu-go agent
  hosts: "{{ group_name }}"

# If we ever decide to move away from the script install, here are the install steps from the collection:
#
  # - name: Fetch the apt repository key
  #   uri:
  #     url: https://{{ packagecloud_auth }}packagecloud.io/sensu/{{ channel }}/gpgkey
  #     force_basic_auth: true
  #     return_content: true
  #   register: apt_key_download
    # Fetching resource into memory does not change the system at all, so we
    # never report a change here (helps keep the playbook idempotent). And by the
    # same line of reasoning, we are also safe to run in check mode (the uri
    # module does not support check mode and would cause us grief if we skipped it).
    # changed_when: false
    # check_mode: false
