# This file enables warm standby on Postgresql 15. There are four variables involved:
# postgresql_cluster_member [true/false], default: false: Activates this file.
# postgresql_leader [true/false], default: true: If the box is the leader
# postgresql_replication_leader [hostname]: Which host is the leader of the
#   cluster the host is a member of
# postgresql_cluster_hosts [Array[hostname]]: List of hosts which are a member
#   of the cluster this host is part of.
